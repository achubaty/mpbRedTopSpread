### `mpbRedTopSpread`

Spread is modeled as an asymmetric percolation process, based on the availability of pine and distance to beetle sources.
Infested pixels disperse "propagules", which follow a dispersal kernel and settle in pixels based on the proportion pine in the receiving pixel, such that cells with more pine accept more propagules.
Pattern Oriented Modeling (POM; e.g., @Grimm:2005sc, @Grimm:2012pom), a heuristic optimization approach, is used to select the dispersal kernel and its parameters, as well as the parameters associated with asymmetric spread, based on the MPB attack data.
The POM-fit parameterization is then used for projecting MPB spread into the future.

Currently, the module implements a negative exponential dispersal kernel (others will be implemented) and we use the `spread2` function from the `SpaDES.tools` package [@Chubaty:2018st] to disperse propagules.
